# top-library

This project is based on The Odin Project curriculum (How to organize code).

Goals:

- Use ES6 class 'syntax' to create book objects (The Odin Project Curriculum - Classes)
- Use localStorage, to save book objects into array
- Convert stored objects in localStorage, so object method can be applied and displayed
- Associate DOM Elements with actual book objects
